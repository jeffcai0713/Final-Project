      <description>0. Introduction In this Exploratory Project, I gathered two datasets, one with NBA (National Basketball Association) player’s statistics for the 2019 season, and the other of the advanced stats for these players for the season. I was able to aquire and decide what to use from the databases given to me as well as small amounts of research on a search engine for an appropriate dataset that would fufill the parameters for this project.</description>

      <description>Modeling Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (as a PDF) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 5/1/2020. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later! In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>
